# @lezer/graffiticode

This is a Graffiticode grammar for the [lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/) parser system.

This grammar is a starting point for implementing the Graffiticode functional DSL. It is currently based on JSON syntax and will be extended to support the specific features of the Graffiticode language.
